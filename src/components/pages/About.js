      <h1>About</h1>
 <p>I'm a full stack developer at the University of Pennsylvania LPS coding boot camp. I'm obsessed with all things art and design and love playing with modular synthesizers, reading sci-fi novels, collecting houseplants, 35mm photography, listening to science podcasts, and adding to my ever growing stash of artist books/zines/graphic novels. I have a BFA in Film/Cinema Studies from Pratt Institute and an MFA in Digital & Interdisciplinary Practice from City University of New York.

The intersection of code, design, and environmentalism is an endless source of fascination for me. Previous to becoming a front end developer, I worked in commercial printing, the art world, and academia. In learning more about coding, I hope to interact with the technology that surrounds me in a more meaningful way.</p>
